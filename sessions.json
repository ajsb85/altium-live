But, in recent years, times to market have decreased, supply chain complexity has increased, and the interplays between the electrical and non-electrical parts of most products have become exceedingly complex. To meet these challenges effectively, engineers and product designers must become comfortable interleaving business, supply chain, and sourcing responsibilities into the technical conversations that they are already having with their vendors and manufacturers. When not doing board design, Jeremy spends a lot of time focused on supply chain optimization, pricing negotiations, and program management. Pulling from that experience, Jeremy will explain how significant price, performance, and timeline benefits can be realized by expanding your skill sets into these areas, and actively participating in them, alongside your colleagues who may be focused on them. Jeremy will provide specific examples of when and how interacting more closely with your component distributors and manufacturers earlier in the design process can save you time in the long run, despite it sometimes feeling like it is \"distracting\" from the design work at hand.",
